# Convergence Studies for High-Order Runge-Kutta Schemes

This folder contains **Jupyter notebooks** for all convergence studies supporting:
 all the convergence studies for each of huestrics can be run in seperate note books for simplicity the 2D brusselator takes a bit of time to run but all huestrics show third order convergence
