Dynamic Heuristic Optimisation in High-Order Runge-Kutta Schemes using Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms

This repository contains code accompanying the paper:

Dynamic Heuristic Optimisation in High-Order Runge-Kutta Schemes using Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms.

The symbolic verification from the paper tests whether the Heuristics scale in this study we start from 15 stages and go up to 30 stages in increments of 3 stages.
