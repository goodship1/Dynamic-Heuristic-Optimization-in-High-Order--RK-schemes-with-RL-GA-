## ðŸ“„ Overview

We present a novel pipeline for discovering and validating high-stage, third-order Rungeâ€“Kutta (RK) methods with extended stability regions:

1. **Symbolic verification** that our heuristics scale from 15 to 30 stages (in increments of 3) with only polynomial cost  
2. **Numerical validation** on 1D and 2D Brusselator PDEs, demonstrating clean third-order convergence and enlarged stability regions each huestric from the paper has it only file with the huestric as the file name.
